# Terminal Knowledge and Setup

## Terminal Client Choice

**Terminal Client:** Visual Studio Code Integrated Terminal with PowerShell

**Why I chose this setup:**
- **Seamless integration**: The VS Code integrated terminal is built into my code editor, so I don't need to switch between windows
- **Context awareness**: The terminal automatically opens in my project directory
- **PowerShell advantages**: 
  - Native to Windows, well-supported
  - Object-oriented (not just text-based like traditional shells)
  - Access to .NET framework
  - Better handling of Windows file paths and commands
- **Convenience**: One less application to manage - everything is in VS Code

## Customizations Made

### VS Code Terminal Settings
- **Color Theme**: Matching my VS Code theme for consistency
- **Shell Selection**: Set PowerShell as default shell

### Git Commands
1. **`git status`** - Check the current state of my repository
2. **`git log --oneline -5`** - View recent commit history in a compact format
3. **`git rm --cached <file>`** - Remove files from git tracking without deleting them locally.
