 Research & Learn

1. How does a Kanban board work, and how does it help manage workflow?
A Kanban board visualizes the team’s workflow by showing tasks in different stages of progress. Each task is represented as a card that moves across columns as work progresses. This makes it easier to see what’s being worked on, what’s pending, and what’s completed. It helps manage workflow by keeping the process transparent and ensuring that everyone understands the current priorities and bottlenecks.

2. What do the different columns on a Kanban board represent?
The columns usually represent the stages of work, such as:

Backlog: Tasks that need to be done but haven’t been started yet.

In Progress: Tasks currently being worked on.

Blocked: Tasks that can’t move forward due to issues or dependencies.

Done: Completed tasks that have been reviewed or merged.

These columns help the team quickly see where each task stands and identify where help might be needed.

3. How do tasks move through the board, and who is responsible for updating them?
Tasks move from Backlog → In Progress → Blocked (if necessary) → Done.
The person assigned to the task is usually responsible for updating its status. This ensures the board accurately reflects the current state of work and that everyone can track progress in real time.

4. What are the benefits of limiting work in progress (WIP)?
Limiting WIP helps prevent team members from taking on too many tasks at once, which can lead to context switching and decreased focus. It encourages finishing what’s already started before moving on to new work, improving overall quality and flow efficiency.

 Reflection

1. How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?
Kanban makes priorities visible by showing what’s currently in progress and what’s queued next. By limiting WIP, it helps team members focus on fewer tasks at a time, reducing the feeling of overload and helping maintain consistent progress. It also allows the team to quickly adjust priorities if something more urgent comes up.

2. How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?
I can improve my workflow by breaking down large tasks into smaller, more manageable ones and updating progress regularly. Keeping my cards up to date helps me stay organized and gives the team a clear view of what I’m working on. It also helps me focus on finishing one thing before moving to the next.

 Task

I saw Focus Bear’s Kanban board when I was in the standup meeting, and I think it’s well-structured and organized. The workflow is clear, and tasks are properly categorized based on their status. However, since I’m still in the onboarding phase, I haven’t been able to contribute to the board yet. Once I’m fully onboarded, I’ll start moving tasks through the process and updating their statuses accordingly.
