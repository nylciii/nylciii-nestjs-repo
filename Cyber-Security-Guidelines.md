 Research & Learn

What are common cyber security threats in a remote work environment?
Common threats include phishing and social engineering, malware (including ransomware), account takeover from reused or leaked passwords, insecure public Wi-Fi, lost or stolen devices, and malicious links or attachments. Attackers often target remote workers because perimeter protections are weaker and people may be more distracted or rushed.

What are best practices for keeping your devices and accounts secure?
Use long, unique passwords for every account and store them in a password manager. Turn on two-factor authentication wherever possible. Keep operating systems and apps up to date, enable automatic security updates, lock devices when not in use, avoid using public Wi-Fi without a VPN, and only install trusted software. Regular backups and least-privilege access (only granting permissions people need) are also important.

Why is it important to lock your computer when away from your desk?
Locking your computer prevents someone nearby from accessing company data or sending messages from your account. Even a short unattended moment can lead to accidental data exposure or intentional misuse, so locking helps protect credentials, sensitive files, and ongoing sessions.

How should you handle phishing attempts and suspicious links?
Pause and verify. Check the sender address, hover over links to see the real URL, and never enter credentials from a link in an unexpected email. If something looks off, contact the sender via a known channel, report the message to your security team or provider, and delete it. Use built-in email reporting tools and run antivirus scans if you interacted with a suspicious attachment.

What makes a strong password, and why use a password manager?
A strong password is long (passphrases are great), unique per account, and not tied to personal info. A password manager lets you generate and store complex, unique passwords so you don’t have to remember them. That prevents reuse and makes account compromise much harder.

Why is two-factor authentication (2FA) important, and when should you enable it?
2FA adds a second form of verification (like an authenticator code or push approval) beyond a password. It blocks attackers who have a password but not the second factor. Enable 2FA on email, cloud services, code repositories, and any accounts with sensitive data — basically everywhere it’s offered.

 Reflection

What security measures do you currently follow, and where can you improve?
Right now I have two-factor authentication enabled on my personal Gmail, I lock my devices when I step away, and I avoid clicking suspicious links. I can improve by adopting a password manager, setting up regular encrypted backups, and doing more frequent audits of connected apps and account recovery options.

How can you make secure behaviour a habit rather than an afterthought?
Automate where possible: enable auto-lock and automatic updates, use a password manager so creating secure credentials becomes effortless, and set small routines like a quick security check at the end of the day. Regular short training refreshers and checklists help too — habits stick when they’re easy to follow daily.

What steps will you take to ensure your passwords and accounts are secure?
I’ll start using a password manager, create long unique passphrases for accounts, enable 2FA on all supported services, review and tighten recovery options, and revoke access for unused third-party apps. I’ll also periodically review account activity and change passwords if I see anything suspicious.

What would you do if you suspected a security breach or suspicious activity on your account?
Immediately change the password for the affected account, enable or re-enroll 2FA, and sign out all active sessions. Scan my device for malware, check recent account activity for unauthorized actions, revoke third-party app access, and inform the security contact or admin. If it’s a work account, escalate to IT/security so they can take broader protective steps.

 Task

The Gmail I’m currently using already has two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled. In the future, when I get my work account, I’ll ensure it’s secured the same way — strong unique passwords, 2FA enabled, and all the other cybersecurity practices I’ve learned (auto-lock, careful link handling, password manager, and regular backups). Right now I’m still in onboarding, so I can’t contribute changes to Focus Bear’s security setup yet, but once I’m fully onboarded I’ll apply these measures to my work account and follow any company security policies.
