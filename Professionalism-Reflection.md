 Research & Learn
Professional vs. unprofessional in casual environments:
Professional:

Showing up to meetings on time
Following through on commitments
Asking questions when unclear
Admitting mistakes early
Using appropriate channels (Slack for quick questions, email for formal requests)

Unprofessional:

Ghosting messages or missing deadlines without warning
Talking over people in meetings
Complaining publicly instead of addressing issues directly
Making jokes at others' expense

Respectful remote communication:

Assume good intent - tone is hard to read in text
Use reactions/emojis to show you've seen messages
Disagree with ideas, not people ("What if we tried X instead?" not "That won't work")
Respond to feedback with "Thanks, I'll adjust that" not excuses

Giving/receiving feedback:

Give: Be specific about actions. "The API response was missing error codes" beats "This needs work"
Receive: Ask clarifying questions. "Can you show me an example?" helps more than getting defensive

 Reflection
Great teamwork I've experienced:
The best teams I've been on shared problems early. When someone was stuck, they said "I'm hitting a wall with X" instead of going silent. People jumped in to help without being asked. No one pretended to know everything.
Making my communication clear and inclusive:

Write like I'm explaining to past-me when I was confused
Use simple language, avoid jargon unless everyone knows it
Check Slack regularly so people aren't waiting on me
If I disagree, I explain why and suggest alternatives

Creating a positive environment:

Celebrate when teammates solve hard problems
Admit when I don't understand something
Share resources that helped me
Keep video on in meetings when possible (helps connection)

Preparing for meetings:

Review agenda beforehand
Write down questions
Have my notes/code ready to share screen if needed
If I'm blocked on something, prepare specific details to discuss

Being proactive:

When I finish a task, ask what's next instead of waiting
If I see a potential issue, flag it early
Document things that confused me (helps next person)
Suggest improvements when I notice patterns

Following up on requests:

Day 1: Send clear request with context
Day 2-3: Gentle ping if urgent ("Hey, just checking if you saw this?")
Day 4-5: If still no response, mention in standup or ping their manager
Escalate when: Something blocks my work for 3+ days, or impacts a deadline

Things I won't do:

Pretend I understand when I don't
Make commitments I can't keep
Blame others when something goes wrong
Let issues fester instead of speaking up
Work in isolation without updates
