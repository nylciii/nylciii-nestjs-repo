📌 Code Formatting & Style Guides

Consistent Code Style
Importance of Consistent Code Style

Having a consistent code style keeps the whole project clean and uniform. It makes the code easier to read and understand, especially when multiple people are working on the same files. It also helps prevent small mistakes that come from mixing different styles or formatting patterns.

Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide

The Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide sets clear rules for writing clean, modern JavaScript — from naming conventions and spacing to how functions, imports, and variables should be structured. It encourages using const and let, proper indentation, avoiding unused variables, and writing code that’s readable and maintainable.


Reflections

Why is code formatting important?
Code formatting keeps everything organized and readable. It reduces confusion, prevents merge conflicts, and makes it easier for others to review or contribute to the project.

What issues did the linter detect?
It flagged unused variables, missing semicolons, inconsistent spacing, and single vs. double quote usage. Some functions also lacked proper indentation.

Did formatting the code make it easier to read?
Yes, definitely. The code looked cleaner and more structured after formatting. It was easier to spot logic flow, and I could focus on understanding the code instead of fixing small style mistakes.
