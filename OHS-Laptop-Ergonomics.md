Risks of using laptop without external monitor/keyboard:

Neck strain from looking down constantly
Hunched shoulders and back pain
Wrist strain from awkward typing angle
Eye strain from screen being too close or low
Poor circulation from static position
Headaches from forward head posture

Ergonomic equipment that helps:

Laptop stand (elevates screen to eye level)
External keyboard and mouse (allows natural arm position)
Ergonomic chair with lumbar support
Footrest if feet don't reach floor
Monitor arm for adjustable positioning
Blue light filter glasses for eye strain

Proper workspace adjustments:

Monitor: Top of screen at or slightly below eye level, arm's length away
Chair: Feet flat on floor, knees at 90°, back supported
Keyboard/mouse: Elbows at 90°, wrists neutral (not bent up or down)
Lighting: No glare on screen, adequate room lighting

Daily habits to reduce strain:

20-20-20 rule: Every 20 min, look 20 feet away for 20 seconds
Stand/stretch every hour
Shoulder rolls and neck stretches
Walk during calls when possible
Posture check every 30 minutes

 Reflection
Equipment changes I've made:
I recently bought a laptop stand to elevate my screen and started using an external keyboard and mouse. This already helps a lot - my neck isn't constantly bent down anymore, and my wrists are in a better position when typing.
What I still need to improve:

Get a proper chair with lumbar support (currently using a regular dining chair)
Check if my screen height is actually at eye level or needs adjusting
Maybe add a second monitor later for less head turning

Behavioral changes I'm implementing:

Sitting upright - I catch myself slouching a lot. Need to actively think about keeping shoulders back
Taking regular breaks - I get hyperfocused and forget to move for hours
Adjusting lighting - Sometimes work with harsh overhead light causing screen glare
Not working from bed/couch - Tempting but terrible for posture

Reminders to maintain good posture:
Since I work on Focus Bear, I should actually use our own movement break feature. I'll set:

Movement reminders every 45-60 minutes
Quick posture check notifications every 30 minutes
End-of-day stretch routine

Also considering putting a sticky note on my monitor: "Is your back against the chair?"
 Task
Workspace adjustment I made:
Set up my laptop stand and external keyboard/mouse properly:

Laptop elevated so top of screen is at eye level when sitting straight
External keyboard positioned so elbows are at 90° and wrists are flat
Mouse close to keyboard so I'm not reaching
Chair adjusted so feet are flat on floor

Equipment that improved my setup:
The laptop stand was game-changing. Before, I was constantly looking down and my neck would hurt by afternoon. Now the screen is at eye level and I actually notice when I'm slouching forward.
Next equipment goal: Get a proper office chair with adjustable height and lumbar support.
Movement reminder experiment:
Used Focus Bear's movement breaks for a full workday with 50-minute intervals. Results:

Positive: Caught myself before getting too stiff, more aware of posture overall
Challenge: Sometimes interrupted during deep focus - adjusted to 60-minute intervals
Improvement: Neck and shoulder tension significantly reduced by end of day

One habit I'm committing to:
Every hour, stand up for at least 2 minutes - even if just to refill water or do quick stretches at my desk. The movement break reminder makes this automatic instead of relying on willpower.
