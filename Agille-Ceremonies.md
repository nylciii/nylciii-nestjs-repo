1. What are the main Agile ceremonies, and what is their purpose?
The main Agile ceremonies are Daily Stand-ups, Sprint Planning (or Continuous Prioritization in Kanban), Retrospectives, and Backlog Refinement.

Daily Stand-ups: Short meetings where the team shares what they did yesterday, what they plan to do today, and any blockers they’re facing. It keeps everyone aligned on progress and issues.

Sprint Planning: A session where the team decides which tasks or stories to work on for the next sprint. It helps set realistic goals and clear priorities. In Kanban, this is done continuously rather than per sprint.

Retrospectives: Meetings held after a sprint to reflect on what went well, what didn’t, and how the team can improve in future cycles.

Backlog Refinement: A process where the team reviews, clarifies, and prioritizes items in the backlog to ensure they’re ready for upcoming work.

2. How do Agile teams collaborate asynchronously and across time zones?
Agile teams use tools like Slack, Notion, and Jira to share updates and track tasks without needing to be online at the same time. Documentation, async stand-ups, and well-detailed task notes allow team members in different time zones to stay informed and contribute effectively. This approach helps maintain productivity and communication even with schedule differences.


Reflection

1. How do Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment?
Agile ceremonies help ensure everyone is on the same page. Daily Stand-ups make it easy to share updates and blockers, Sprint Planning aligns everyone on goals, and Retrospectives give the team space to improve collaboration. These ceremonies create consistent communication and help the team move in sync, reducing confusion or duplicated work.

2. Which ceremony do you think is most important for your role, and why?
For me as a backend engineer intern, the Daily Stand-up is the most important. It’s a chance to share progress, ask for help if I’m stuck, and understand how my work fits into the bigger picture. It also helps me stay accountable and connected with the rest of the team, especially when working remotely.

Task

So I joined the daily standup meeting, and actually this is not my first time having one, since I already have experience freelancing for a project which we built a SaaS app, but I like how the meeting with Focusbear was straight to the point / straightfoward. To improve my contribution next time, I'll need to be able to have an important task first, since right now I'm still finishing my onboarding.
