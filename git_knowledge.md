Have you used Git before? If so, in what context?

- Yes I have used git a lot before, especially in doing our thesis in college, and in my personal projects also
since it is really important to be able to have commited changes.

Which Git client (if any) did you choose? Why?

- I've used Github desktop before, but right now I prefer using git bash, because git bash trains you to become really expert in using git, and also allows fast commands for your projects. 

What was the most interesting thing you learned about Git today?

- The most interesting thing I learned from git today is that it has a security feature that doesnt allow you to share some important files like tokens in your .env.
