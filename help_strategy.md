📌 When to Use Google, AI Tools, or Ask for Help?


1. When do you prefer using AI vs. searching Google?

- I use AI when:

- I need a quick explanation without reading long articles.

- I want code examples instantly.

- I’m stuck and need the logic broken down step-by-step.

- I’m debugging and want to test different ideas fast.

- The problem is something that AI can reason about (e.g., “Why is my NestJS pipe failing?” or “Explain this error”).

I use Google when:

- I need official documentation.

- I want the most accurate and up-to-date information.

- I’m checking library-specific details (e.g., “TypeORM query options”).

- I need solutions from real developers on StackOverflow or GitHub issues.

- The problem might have known bugs or version-specific issues.

2. How do you decide when to ask a colleague instead?

I ask a colleague when:

- I’ve already tried AI, Google, docs, and still can't get it working.

- The issue involves project-specific logic (e.g., architecture decisions, code patterns your team uses).

- The problem affects other parts of the system, not just my code.

- It’s blocking my work and slowing down the team.

- The bug might be caused by how our project is set up, not by the framework.

3. What challenges do developers face when troubleshooting alone?

- When troubleshooting alone, developers often deal with:

- Overthinking simple problems.

- Tunnel vision (you look at the same code for too long).

- Not knowing the right search keywords.

- Missing context that teammates usually know.

- Lack of experience with certain tools/frameworks.

- Debug fatigue — you get tired and make mistakes.

- Not seeing obvious errors (missing imports, typos, wrong ports).
