 Research & Learn

What AI tools are typically used for your role?
As a backend engineering intern, I usually use AI tools to help generate boilerplate code, draft SQL queries, explain error messages, and suggest improvements to code structure. I also use AI for quick documentation summaries and to better understand unfamiliar libraries or frameworks.

What are the benefits and risks of using AI in a professional setting?
The benefit is that AI helps speed up development time and can guide me toward solutions faster, especially when I’m stuck. It also helps explain concepts clearly. The risk is that AI might produce incorrect information, outdated practices, or insecure code. There’s also a chance of relying on it too much instead of learning the skill myself.

What types of information should never be entered into AI tools?
Anything confidential — like company secrets, internal APIs, tokens, credentials, customer data, or private logs. Basically, anything that could expose Focus Bear’s internal systems or users.

How can you fact-check and validate AI-generated content to ensure accuracy?
I review the output manually, compare it with official documentation, test the code in a controlled environment, and ask a senior developer if I’m unsure. I also check if the solution follows best practices and security standards.

 Reflection

When should you use AI for assistance, and when should you rely on your own skills?
I use AI when I need inspiration, explanations, or examples — especially for repetitive tasks. However, I rely on my own skills (and documentation) when making decisions that affect architecture, data security, or production systems. For important parts of the codebase, I prefer to think through logic myself to genuinely learn.

How can you avoid over-reliance on AI while still benefiting from it?
I treat AI like a mentor, not a shortcut. I make sure I understand the logic behind the answer and try to solve the issue first before asking for help. I also practice reading documentation and debugging on my own so I don’t lose confidence in my skills.

What steps will you take to ensure data privacy when using AI tools?
I’ll avoid pasting logs with personal data, strip out credentials, anonymize information, and keep internal details vague. I’ll also follow whatever security guidelines the team recommends.

  Task

Identify one task you can improve using an AI tool, and try it out.
One task I improved was generating boilerplate code for API endpoints. I used AI to draft a template, which saved time and kept the structure clean. I still customized and refactored it afterward.

Review the AI-generated output critically — did it require editing or fact-checking?
Yes, I had to modify some parts. For example, the error handling was too general, and I had to change the database query to match our schema. I also double-checked security concerns like SQL injection.

Document one best practice you will follow when using AI tools at Focus Bear.
I’ll always review AI-generated code carefully, run it through tests, and validate it against official documentation before using it. I’ll never copy-paste blindly.
