📌 Introduction to Unit Testing with Jest


1. Automated testing is important because it keeps the codebase stable as it grows. Bugs get caught early, changes are safer to make, and the app becomes easier to maintain. It also prevents features from breaking when new updates are added. Consistent automated tests give confidence that the system behaves the way it should.

2. Writing the first Jest test can be challenging because the testing flow feels new. Understanding what to expect, how to structure a test, and how to mock dependencies often takes a moment to get used to. Another challenge is learning the difference between testing logic and testing behavior, especially when moving from simple functions to async code or components.
