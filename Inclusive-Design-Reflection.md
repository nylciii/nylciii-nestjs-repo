My Reflection on Supporting Neurodivergent Users and Team Members
 Research & Learn
Vulnerable populations in digital spaces face overwhelming interfaces, unclear instructions, time pressure, and inaccessible error messages. They include neurodivergent individuals, people with mental health conditions, and those with cognitive/physical disabilities.
Key ethical considerations:

Let users control their experience, don't force behaviors
Avoid harsh sounds, flashing elements, visual clutter
Use clear language, predictable patterns
Don't punish users for needing breaks
Never be patronizing

Making interactions accessible:

Simple, direct language
Consistent navigation
Break tasks into small steps
Allow pausing and easy undoing
Smart defaults to reduce decisions

Supporting neurodivergent teammates:

Written summaries after meetings
Clear expectations and deadlines
Respect async communication preferences
Flexible schedules and quiet work options

 Reflection
How I'll adjust my communication:
As someone who also struggles with focus, I know vague feedback is frustrating. I'll:

Be specific in error messages ("Session expired after 30 min" not "Something went wrong")
Front-load important info
Show examples, not just descriptions
Avoid time pressure language

Common pitfalls I need to avoid as a backend dev:

Inconsistent app behavior that creates anxiety
Silent failures where users blame themselves
Complex error recovery
Not autosaving (data loss anxiety)
Over-notification

One practical change:
I'll structure every error message as:

What happened (plain language)
What to do next (specific action)
Easy escape hatch

 Task
Design improvement: Build "compassionate recovery" into backend logic. When users miss sessions, don't mark them as "failed" - instead offer to reschedule and track "attempts" not just "completions." Use language like "rescheduled" instead of "missed."
Practice response to struggling user:

Hey [Name],
You're not failing - reaching out shows real self-awareness.
I struggle with focus too (I'm a dev here). Reminders alone often don't work because our brains are already committed to something else when they pop up.
What might help:

Auto-start sessions at specific times instead of waiting to remember
Try 10-minute sessions if 25 feels too big
Stack with existing habits (after coffee, after lunch)

I've noted your feedback - we're working on smarter nudges. You're not wrong for the app; the app needs to work harder for you.
