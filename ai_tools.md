ðŸ“Œ Set Up AI Tools for Development



Which AI tools did you try?

I have already tried all of them. Chatgpt, claude, and github co pilot, even gemini.

What worked well? What didnâ€™t?

All of them works well, but based from my research this ai tools have different strengths, like how claude is better in lingustics, while chatgpt is very good in debugging code. 

When do you think AI is most useful for coding?

Ai is most useful in coding if you want to be able to work quickly, and be able to fix bugs in your code base efficiently.
